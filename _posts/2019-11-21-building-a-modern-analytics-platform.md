I hope with this post to discuss the current state of analytics in AWS Cloud.

### What is a data lake?

A data lake could be considered as a centralised repository of information, except data can be structured or unstructured.
The data is usually stored in S3, and the data is used for data exploration, reporting, analytics, machine learning and artifical intelligence.
A datalake makes the data available to more users across more lines of business, to be analysed for insights.

Since the data is heterogeneous, (data with high variability of data types and formats) it needs to be transformed
before it can be analysed

### Why is S3 the primary storage?

- Scalable (almost unlimited scalability)
- Performance
- Availability 
- Durability
- Cost effective (especially when moving to cheaper tiers automatically)
- Easy to transfer 
- Data insights
- Security is very good
- Compliance (has been audited by many authorities and proved compliant)
- Auditing
- Pluggable into event notifications, such as SQS, SNS or Lambda
- Versioning (if needed)
- Cross region replication
- Flexible access control mechanisms (bucket policies, temporary links etc.)
- Access logs

Other benefits directly related to this post is that S3 plugs into to numerous analytics and machine learning services provided by AWS.

### What is AWS Glue and how does it work?

ETL is defined as a process that extracts the data from different source systems, transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) and then loads the data into the Data Warehouse system. 
ETL full-form is Extract, Transform and Load.

The way AWS Glue works, is that you:

- Point a Glue crawler at a data source.
- Crawler will create data catalogue with enough information to recreate the dataset.
- Glue jobs are then used to perform the ETL (jobs can be run on demand or using triggers).

Once AWS Glue has catalogued the data, it is ready to be used for analytics.
You can use tools like AWS Athena to analyse and process data, or you can view visualise analytical results within quicksight.

### AWS Glue Data Catalogue

AWS Glue solves the problem of analysing heterogeneous data types, it provides one central location for
all your company data, including data from on premises, which solves the problem of data silos in different locations.
It uses Glue crawlers to gather schemas and statistics about the data, and populates the Glue Data Catalogue with the mgathered metadata.

Glue automatically generates the ETL code to:
- Extract the data from the source
- Transform the data to match the target schema
- Load the data source into the target

There are other types of transformations you can apply during this stage.
The Glue jobs can be run on demand, on a schedule or based on events


### What is AWS Athena? 

Athena can be described as a serverless interactive query service, for allowing instantaneous querying of datasets within S3.
It can query unstructured, semi structured and structured datasets, and will scale automatically depending on the size of the operation.

The query language used is Presto, which is an open source, distributed sql query engine.
It can query data in any format, such as CSV, JSON or columular data such as Parquet.
It is extremely fast, and executes queries in parrallel, and is optimised for fast performance with Amazon S3.

Athena integrates with AWS Glue.

### How the integration works

- AWS Glue crawler will crawl S3 bucket (raw dataset)
- AWS Glue crawler writes metadata into Data Catalogue
- When you run a query in Athena over the raw datasets in S3
- Schema definitions are used from Data Catalogue to optimise the queries
